This matlab code creates flickering gabor patches. The parameters can be edited according to your requirements. It requires Psychtoolbox installed already. 
The Gabor patch is being created using CreateProceduralGabor function from the Psychtoolbox. The flickering effect can be made by modulating the contrast. 
Flickering gabor patches can be used to understand frequency following phenomenon in different brain regions.

The flickering effect is achieved by modulating the contrast of the patch. The image below shows the contrast modulation of a 5Hz flickering Gabor patch.
